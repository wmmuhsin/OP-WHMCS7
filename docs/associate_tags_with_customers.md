# Send custom emails to different clients

The Openprovider whitelabel email functionality is a powerful tool which allows you to send custom emails to clients and end users with any design and branding you choose. From the [settings page](https://cp.openprovider.eu/account/overview-configuration.php) in you account, you can see all the emails which can be customized. 

With tags, you can expand this tool with even a higher amount of granularity. By assigning tags to your clients, you can send custom emails to them and their end users. Many potential options for how this could be used. One option is offering custom branding to your clients who are also resellers.
